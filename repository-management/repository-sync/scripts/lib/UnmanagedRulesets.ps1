# Removes any repository-level rulesets from a target repository that were
# not created by our Terraform automation.
#
# Background: `terraform/modules/github/github.rulesets.tf` is the
# single source of truth for repository-level rulesets on every AVM repo.
# Three rulesets are managed there:
#   * "Azure Verified Modules"             (target=branch)
#   * "Only allow v tags"                  (target=tag)
#   * "Must not delete/update version tags" (target=tag)
# Anything else that shows up at the repository scope was created manually
# (or by some other tool) outside our automation, and silently shadows or
# weakens the policies we ship. This module enumerates repository-scoped
# rulesets and deletes anything whose `name` is not in the managed list.
#
# Org-level / enterprise-level rulesets are deliberately NOT touched:
#   * The list endpoint is called with `includes_parents=false` so the
#     response only contains rulesets defined ON this repository.
#   * Each candidate is additionally double-checked against
#     `source_type == "Repository"` before we DELETE it.
# So the org-wide `azure-production-ruleset` (and any future org/enterprise
# rulesets) are out of scope and will never be enumerated, let alone
# deleted, by this function.
#
# Endpoints:
#   GET    /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets?includes_parents=false
#   DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}
# Both require the "Administration" repo permission, which the AVM bot has
# on every repo it governs.
#
# Plan mode logs each unmanaged ruleset with `[PLAN]` and never deletes.
# Apply mode logs and then issues a `DELETE` against the ruleset (204 = ok,
# 404 = already gone in a race).
#
# Returns:
#   @{
#     IssueLog       = updated issue log
#     RemovedCount   = number of unmanaged rulesets deleted (0 in plan mode)
#     DetectedNames  = string[] of unmanaged ruleset names that were
#                      detected (regardless of plan vs apply)
#   }
